Full Build Scope ù Cognitive Support & Memory Preservation Platform 
 
Platform Overview 
A native mobile app for the primary user (person with cognitive decline), a web-based caregiver 
portal for administrators and family managers, and a lightweight contributor interface for 
extended family and friends. All three interfaces share a common backend. The product is 
positioned as a wellness and lifestyle tool, not a medical device. 
 
User Roles 
Primary User ù the person with cognitive decline. Interacts exclusively through the mobile app. 
Cannot modify settings, manage accounts, or access administrative functions. All configuration 
is done on their behalf by the caregiver. Authentication is simplified (PIN, biometric, or no-auth 
auto-login). This person never creates an account, enters a password, or manages preferences 
directly. 
Caregiver/Administrator ù typically an adult child, spouse, or professional caregiver. Full access 
to the web portal. Creates and manages the primary userÆs account and profile. Uploads and 
moderates all content. Configures accessibility settings, reminders, contacts, games, AI 
assistant behavior, notification preferences, and privacy controls. Views all engagement 
analytics and activity logs. Manages contributor access. This is the person who purchases, sets 
up, and maintains the platform. 
Contributor ù extended family and friends. Access through a shared link or optional lightweight 
account. Can upload photos, record video messages, and record voice messages for the 
primary user. Cannot access analytics, settings, or the primary userÆs content library. Content 
may pass through caregiver moderation before reaching the primary user depending on 
configuration. 
 
Primary User Mobile App (iOS & Android ù React Native/Expo) 
Core Platform 
Accessibility-first UI framework with enforced minimum touch targets, dynamic font scaling 
across four sizes, high contrast mode, dark/light themes, haptic feedback, audio feedback, 
reduced motion mode, orientation lock, and full screen reader support. Custom component 
library that enforces all accessibility rules at the code level so no feature can violate the design 
principles. 
Home screen with time-of-day greeting using userÆs name and photo, full natural-language date 
display, four fixed-position color-coded feature tiles (Memories, Family, Games, Talk to Me), 
daily highlight strip with rotating content, and subtle new-content indicators without number 
badges. 
Navigation system enforcing a two-tap maximum depth to any feature. Persistent bottom 
navigation bar with center Home button visible on every screen. Consistent back button 
placement with text label. No hamburger menus, no drawers, no gesture-required navigation, no 
time-limited interactions. Gentle non-technical error handling throughout. 
Voice system with persistent microphone button on every screen, natural language intent 
recognition handling imprecise and varied speech, global and contextual voice commands, 

voice guidance output with configurable speech speed, tolerance for long pauses, repetition, 
mumbling, and background noise. Optional wake word. 
Offline architecture with proactive caching of recent photos, recordings, video messages, 
contact data, game assets, reminders, and morning briefing data. Silent background sync on 
reconnect. Graceful fallbacks for all connectivity-dependent features. 
Simplified authentication configurable by caregiver: no-auth, PIN, biometric, or 
caregiver-initiated unlock. No session timeout while app is in foreground. Configurable grace 
period when backgrounded. 
Caregiver-driven onboarding with connection via QR code or numeric code. Primary user sees a 
welcome screen with their own photo, an optional four-screen tour, and lands on the home 
screen in under 60 seconds with no account creation.

on silence, auto-stop after extended silence, confirmation screen, and automatic speech-to-text

AI-assisted tag suggestions, and caregiver manual tagging. Tag types include people, places, 
dates, life periods, themes, and custom. 
Timeline view with vertical scrollable cards showing thumbnails, titles, dates, and tags. Date 
headers while scrolling. Filter toggle buttons by type, life period, and people. Caregiver-curated 
named collections. 
Memory playback for photos (full-screen with associated audio playback option and navigation 
arrows), voice recordings (auto-play with waveform and optional scrolling transcription), and 
videos (full-screen with play/pause only). 
Slideshow mode with full-screen crossfade display, configurable duration per photo, voice 
recording narration with auto-duration override, background music with caregiver-selected 
genre, auto volume adjustment, minimal tap-to-reveal controls, and caregiver-built named 
slideshows with custom order and music.

with notification, home screen display, and offline support. 
Text entry alternative for stories with large-font keyboard and voice-to-text dictation.
